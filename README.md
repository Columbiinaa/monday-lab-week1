# Synthetic Dog Breed Dataset Generation
**CSET419 – Introduction to Generative AI | Lab–1**

---

## Objective
To generate a synthetic image dataset of dog breeds using a pre-trained Generative AI model and organize the generated images into labeled folders.

---

## Domain
Image Data Generation

---

## Generative Model Used
Stable Diffusion (Diffusion-based Generative AI Model) using Hugging Face Diffusers.

---

## Dataset Description
This dataset consists of synthetically generated images of different dog breeds.
Each breed is treated as a class label and stored in a separate folder.

> Note: Dog is one species (*Canis lupus familiaris*). Breeds are used as labels.

## Dog Breeds (Labels)
- Labrador Retriever
- German Shepherd
- Golden Retriever
- Bulldog
- Poodle
- Beagle
- Rottweiler
- Siberian Husky

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Google Colab
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Diffusers
- Stable Diffusion v1.5

---

## Execution Environment
Executed on Google Colab with GPU acceleration.

---

## How to Run
1. Open Google Colab  
2. Enable GPU  
3. Install dependencies  
4. Run the dataset generation script

---

## Output
A labeled synthetic image dataset of dog breeds.

---

## Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates the use of Generative AI models to create synthetic datasets using Stable Diffusion.
